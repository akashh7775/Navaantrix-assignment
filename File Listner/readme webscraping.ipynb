    "# Web Scraping for Product Details (Amazon & Flipkart)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python project was built to scrape product details like name, price, and ratings from two e-commerce websites — Amazon and Flipkart — based on user search input. The goal was to collect this data and export it into an Excel file with separate sheets for each site.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Project Does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes a dynamic search term from the user (e.g., \"mobile\", \"headphones\")\n",
    "- Scrapes product details from Amazon and Flipkart\n",
    "- Extracts the product name, price, and rating\n",
    "- Saves the results in an Excel file (`product_results.xlsx`) with two sheets:\n",
    "  - `Amazon`\n",
    "  - `Flipkart`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3\n",
    "- `requests` – for sending web requests\n",
    "- `BeautifulSoup` – for HTML parsing\n",
    "- `pandas` – for storing and exporting data\n",
    "- `openpyxl` – to write Excel files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known Challenges Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on this project, I faced some real-world web scraping challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flipkart and Amazon use advanced anti-bot mechanisms** (like dynamic JavaScript content, IP blocks, and bot detection headers).\n",
    "- Because of this, scraping sometimes **returns empty pages or missing product blocks**.\n",
    "- This is why, during testing, **the output may show only headers (no product rows)** in the Excel file.\n",
    "- As a workaround, I also prepared a version of the project that uses **dummy product data** when actual scraping fails. This helped ensure the Excel export logic could still be demonstrated correctly for submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the required libraries:\n",
    "pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl\n",
    "\n",
    "markdown\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the notebook and enter a product name when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script will attempt to scrape data from both Amazon and Flipkart.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Results are saved in `product_results.xlsx` in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each product entry will ideally look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Product Name       | Price    | Rating  |\n",
    "|--------------------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| Samsung Galaxy A15 | ₹12,499  | 4.2     |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Files\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Updated_Web_Scraping_Project.ipynb`\n",
    "- `product_results.xlsx`\n",
    "- `README.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to site restrictions, some scraping attempts may fail. That’s expected behavior.\n",
    "- This project was created as part of an interview assignment to demonstrate web scraping, data handling, and file export.\n"
